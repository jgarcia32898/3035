 So that it must, 
 in fine, be maintained,

 or conceived in my mind.

 If you know that you are in ET 309 right now, then you can rule out that you 
 are in bed dreaming (or in the matrix, . . .) that you are in ET 309 right now.

 You cannot rule out that you are dreaming that you are in ET 309 right now.

 Therefore, you do not know that you are in ET 309 right now.
